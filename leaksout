Target process is an ancestor and permitting live process for ancestors so not generating a corpse to save resources by default.
Can't examine target process's malloc zone asan_0x103a8e9d8, so memory analysis will be incomplete or incorrect.
Reason: for security, cannot load non-system library /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/15.0.0/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib

Process 46857 is not debuggable. Due to security restrictions, leaks can only show or save contents of readonly memory of restricted processes.
